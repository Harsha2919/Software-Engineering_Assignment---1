# Near Misses Finder for xn + yn ≠ zn

## Introduction
This program allows an interactive user to search for "near misses" of the form xn + yn ≠ zn, where x, y, z, n, and k are positive integers. The user is prompted to enter values for n (power to use in the equation) and k (limiting the range of x and y possibilities to test). The program then systematically searches for x, y, and z combinations that are "almost right" by finding the smallest "miss" between (xn + yn) and the nearest bracketing values zn and (z+1)n.

## How to Run the Program
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer.
2. Download the `HW1.py` file to your desired location.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the `HW1.py` file is located.
4. Run the program by typing the following command:
python3 HW1.py
